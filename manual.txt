       filter - full text document search

DESCRIPTION

       Filter allows you to load documents into an Elasticsearch cluster/node
       with a given index and document type. If no index or document type is 
       specified, default values are used.
       
       As its main use case, allows full text searches, retrieving documents  
       based on a given query. For that purpose, Elasticsearch API is used.
